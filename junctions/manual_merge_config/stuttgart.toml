# PLEASE NOTE: this tool operates by using two data sets for the same region,
#              one generated by using a smaller, more conservative buffer size
#              when turning junctions into two-dimensional shapes and the other
#              by using a larger, more liberal buffer size.
#              Green shapes correspond to the data set generated using the more
#              conservative buffer, blue ones to the one generated using the more
#              liberal one (that's why you don't have to worry about 'Why am I replacing
#              cluster 11.0 by cluster 11.0 and 12.0??' - they come from different
#              data sets). 
#              The 'conservative' data set is treated as the default, while the user
#              can by means of this tool choose to replace some of the conservative
#              clustering solutions by more liberal ones (i.e.: I'd prefer these
#              junctions to be merged!). Wherever nothing is replaced or deleted,
#              green shapes will remain in the data set without any action being required. 

# (1) Enter (green) clusters to delete.

# Example element:
# delete = [37.0,93.0]

# If you don't want to delete any elements, just leave the list empty:
# delete = []

# (2) Enter green clusters to replace ('old') and the blue ones they will be replaced by ('new').

# Example element:
# [[replace]]
# old = [429.0, 433.0]
# new = 48.0

# Another example element (one [[replace]] block per replacement action!!):
# [[replace]]
# old = [509.0, 507.0]
# new = 62.0
